title: On being a teacher in the Philippines

Last year, I was hired as a teacher in a private school in Metro Manila. This was two months after I graduated from college. With my bachelor's degree in Computer Science, I tried sending out my résumés to tech companies, as a computer student would. I was also to fortunate to have been interviewed&mdash;and even considered for hiring&mdash;by these tech companies. But my life goal has always been to experience teaching.

One of my former classmates told me that this school is in <em>dire</em> need of a computer teacher. <i>Well</i>, I thought, <i>they should be in need knowing that it's already been almost a month after school has started.</i> So I sent my résumé to the school. I was a walk-in applicant, but I was asked to come back the following week, since the principal wasn't around that day. It was thrilling, and I never intended to get hired by this school. I was, after all, a web developer. And it's too early in my career, I thought, for me to become an educator. But I was hired.

## Disillusionment

My first day was exhausting. I had no money, so I had to walk to school and back home. And this was immediately a day after I signed the contract. They are indeed in <em>dire need</em>. To me, it felt heroic, grandiose, and honorable. I was not sitting in front of a Mac computer inside one of those air-conditioned offices that tech companies have; my workspace was a small space in a big dining table that I shared with other teachers in the department I was assigned into, with only our things and stuff demarcating the space that we're ought to own for the school year. It was indeed a very humble position, but I was honored. I could see the 15-year-old me cheering me on from afar.

I was in a trance. And I was living a very elaborate system of self-fraud. Because of this feeling of victory that I had because i have achieved my life goal at such a young age, I willingly blinded myself to how broken the entire education system really is. And my school smarts weren't enough to knock me back into consciousness to see that I was being exploited.

When I signed the contract, the principal told me something. <q><i lang="tl">Baka naman iwan mo kami kapag nakahanap ka ng mas malaking suweldo?</i></q> This was after they told me that the highest salary they could give is just barely the minimum wage. I, being in a trance, believed the illusion that I was doing some good. <i>I didn't need that much money anyway,</i> I told myself. <i>This is an honor, and I should take it.</i> So I did. I promised I won't leave.

Throughout the year, I was slowly awakening from the euphoria. I was ready to leave. I didn't think I was abused by this institution; to the contrary even! They were really helpful, and I learned a lot on the job. I even improved myself. I started seeing school from a different perspective. I used to always face the blackboard from afar, sitting in one of those arm chairs; now I am in front of it, writing things. But from this vantage point, I see a bird's eye view of the Philippine education system. It wasn't just a house leaking when it rains&mdash;it was rotting to the core, and it was smelling pretty bad.

## The Pandemic

I was ready to leave. But then the COVID-19 pandemic
