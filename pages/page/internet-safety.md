## Securing your Facebook account

### Log out of Facebook when you use a computer you share with other people

If you forget, you can log out remotely. You can manage where you’re logged into Facebook in [Security and Login Settings](https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=security). The **Where You’re Logged In** section lists where you’re currently logged in. Each entry includes a date, time, location and device type.

To log out of Facebook on another computer, phone or tablet:

1. Go to your [Security and Login Settings](https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=security).
1. Go to the section **Where You're Logged In**. You may have to click **See More** to see all of the sessions where you're logged in.
1. Find the session you want to end. Click <svg class="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M12 8c1.1 0 2-.9 2-2s-.9-2-2-2-2 .9-2 2 .9 2 2 2zm0 2c-1.1 0-2 .9-2 2s.9 2 2 2 2-.9 2-2-.9-2-2-2zm0 6c-1.1 0-2 .9-2 2s.9 2 2 2 2-.9 2-2-.9-2-2-2z"/></svg> and then click Log Out.
