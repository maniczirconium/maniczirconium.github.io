<p>
  Antares Programming started in 2018. I created it initially as a way to help
  my college classmates learn about the newest technologies on the Web and
  programming best practices. It has grown since.
</p>
<h4>Problem</h4>
<p>
  As a student of Computer Science, I noticed a lot how my classmates had a hard
  time studying programming and web development. Existing documentations and
  tutorials used a lot of jargons. Online resources aimed at beginners are
  better, but these are written or produced in English.
</p>

<p>
  Video tutorials are available in Filipino. However, most of them lack the
  depth necessary to fully understand how the technology work. Most of the
  resources I personally have used and benefitted from could be better by
  explaining what goes on under the hood in a high-level way instead of just
  telling the learners what to do.
</p>

<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>
  I started to formulate a three-way solution for this problem. Antares
  Programming is not intended to replace all of the existing resources; it just
  augments them. It is intended to support existing educational resources by
  curating learning materials from around the Web and creating resources that
  explains what other sources have missed.
</p>

<p>
  Antares Programming provides this service in three ways, all provided in
  Filipino:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Infographics.</b> Using its Facebook page, Antares Programming will
    provide information in the form of infographics. These require the lowest
    cost and energy as these are bite-sized. It also has more mileage as it can
    be shared and re-shared infinite times by Facebook users on their personal
    timeline or in developer Facebook groups. This also serves as a marketing
    strategy as
    <a

      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener"
      >people are more likely to engage with graphic content</a
    >
    as opposed to written articles and videos that take up more of their time.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Written articles.</b> Concepts and topics that need to be discussed in
    more depth are served in the form of written articles. This type of content
    targets learners who prefer reading more than watching videos. These
    articles have to be well-researched while also leading the learner to more
    resources. This is the most important goal of Antares Programming when it
    comes to written articles. Learners have to learn something new after
    reading it and <em>search for more resources on the topic discussed.</em>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Videos.</b> Of these three, videos are the most difficult and costly to
    produce. Videos act as a complement to written articles in that videos
    simplify what written articles discuss. This opens up the target audience
    wider and reaches more people.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  For these solutions, a prominent online presence is essential. For this, I
  created a Facebook page for Antares Programming to reach the highest
  demographic possible. I also created a website to host the written articles
  for people interested in getting into the details. And finally, I have created
  a Youtube channel to host the videos.
</p>

<h4>Design</h4>
<p>
  Design for this project is an ongoing process. At the time of writing, this
  project is in a process of rebuilding its brand after I have taken a hiatus
  from working on it in 2019.
</p>
<p>
  The whole project is separated into three phases to make it easier for me to
  manage over the longer course of time.
</p>

<h5>Phase 1: Facebook Page</h5>
<p>
  The Facebook page was started early on in the project. It serves as a
  marketing tool in building the audience and getting a wider reach. It also
  serves as an information hub for loyal fans of this project. It hosts all of
  the information about new articles and videos.
</p>
<p>
  The Facebook page also serves as a channel of communication between Antares
  Programming and its fans. People send messages to the Facebook page to inquire
  of details about certain topics or just generally ask about a concept they
  don't really get. This is also the main <i>business model</i>, if you will, as
  people get informed that Antares Programming accepts financial donations from
  its fans.
</p>

<h5>Phase 2: Website</h5>
<p>
  The development of the website started a few weeks after the Facebook page was
  published. Initially it was just a simple blog where I write articles about
  web development, particularly about
  <a
    href="https://www.zeldman.com/2018/05/02/transcript-intrinsic-web-design-with-jen-simmons-the-big-web-show/"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noopener"
    >Intrinsic Web Design</a
  >, which I felt really needed to be announced to Filipino developers.
</p>
<p>
  The first iteration of the website was built with
  <a href="https://hexo.io/">Hexo</a>, a blogging engine. It was hosted on
  <a href="https://github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Github Pages</a>.
  It has gone through different iterations in terms of its aesthetics and user
  experience, which also reflected my growth as a web designer during the time.
</p>

<p>
  I built the second iteration of the website when I came back to working on it
  after taking a hiatus in 2019. I decided to rebuild it from scratch. This time
  I used <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, a blogging engine built
  with Ruby, and again, hosted on
  <a href="https://github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Github Pages</a>.
  I chose Jekyll because Github Pages supports it natively, and it allowed me to
  use
  <a href="https://sass-lang.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sass</a> for
  CSS. It also didn't need a database or
  <abbr title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr> since all articles can be
  written in
  <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >Markdown</a
  >, just like in Hexo.
</p>

<h5>Phase 3: Youtube</h5>
<p>
  The third phase of this project started just recently. I opened the Antares
  Programming Youtube channel. It barely has anything, as video production is
  very tedious and costly. But I intend to post videos in the future.
</p>

<h4>Results</h4>
<p>
  At the time of writing, Antares Programming has more than 2,000 fans on its
  Facebook page, and it is still increasing. I have disabled analytics on the
  website since I have reservations on using Google Analytics (data privacy) and
  the alternatives are quite costly for my needs. However, quite a few people
  sent their messages of thanks regarding the website.
