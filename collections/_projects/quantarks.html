<p>
  Quantarks is an augmented reality (AR) application for Android devices that
  serves interactive content to facilitate learning about the periodic table of
  elements. This was our thesis project for my bachelor's degree in Computer
  Science. This project was made by a team that included me and three other
  developers and designers that happened to be my best friends.
</p>

<p>
  For this project, I worked as the lead developer. I also acted as the project
  manager. One of our teammates acted as another developer to help me. The other
  two were user experience (UX) designers, and one of them also worked on
  modelling the 3D objects that we incorporated in the app for the AR
  experience.
</p>



<h4>Problem</h4>


<p>
  Chemistry is subjectively one of the hardest branches of science. And while
  teachers are smart and skilled enough to teach this subject, they could
  benefit from infusing entertainment into education.
</p>



<p>
  The goal of this project is to create a prototype of an application that will
  eventually be used in a classroom setting in the Philippines. It also has to
  solve the following problems:
</p>



<ul>
  

  <li>
    It has to be accessible offline for schools in areas with slow Internet
    connection or none at all.
  </li>
  

  <li>
    It has to be accessible by people with no smartphones, and those with
    smartphones that are not powerful enough to run the application.
  </li>
  

  <li>It should be cost-effective, and as cheap to produce as possible.</li>
  

</ul>



<h4>Solution</h4>



<p>
  We started working on the project mid-2018. We initially explored using
  Android's native application programming interface (API) for the user
  interface (UI), and Unity 3D and Vuforia for the augmented reality section.
  However, as the project progressed, we realized that this is not an ideal
  setup, and it would cost us much later in the development. We decided to scrap
  the UI we had and rebuild it using Unity 3D.
</p>



<p>
  Because of how AR technology worked at the time, we also had to create
  markers, which are pieces of graphics printed on a medium. Each element on the
  periodic table had a unique marker printed on a piece of card that students
  could use personally. These markers were designed by one of our UX designers.
  He also designed a large periodic table with the same markers on it for use in
  a classroom setting.
</p>



<h5>Solving the problems</h5>


<p>
  To tick off every item on the list of problems we need to solve, building the
  app is only a part of the solution. Our goal isn't to just incorporate
  technology into education just because. Our goal is to incorporate
  <em>entertainment</em> into education, and technology is only one of the tools
  to make that happen. This means that we need to work on this project from the
  base, i.e. little technology involved, and progressively enhance from there by
  incorporating technology for those who can afford and use it.

    <ul>
      

      <li>
        On our builds of the application, we built the 3D models into the app
        installer itself. This means that the app will work even in the complete
        absence of Internet connectivity. A consequence of this is the large
        download size (~700mb) of the installer. We think this wouldn't be a
        problem on higher-end devices, as several games on the Google Play Store
        exceed the 1 gigabyte mark for download size.
      </li>
      

      <li>
        We could have improved this further by excluding the 3D models from the
        installer build and instead hosting it on a server. The app then
        downloads it on its first use. Once it has downloaded all 3D models, it
        will not need to connect to the Internet again.
      </li>
      

      <li>
        Another way this could work is instead of downloading everything on
        first use, we only download the 3D model of the element that was scanned
        using the app. We can then save this on the device's cache. But there is
        no guarantee that this will be saved until the next time the app is used
        and will require Internet connectivity more often than that of the other
        two proposed solutions.
      </li>
      

    </ul>
    
 Because of the time constraints our team faced, we were not able to
    exclude the assets from the installer build and host it on a server.

      smartphones that are not powerful enough to run the application.</b
    >
 Instead of designing custom markers from scratch, we used QR codes for
    each element. These QR codes could potentially store plain text that holds
    information about the element. This enables people with no internet
    connection to view the information we want them to know about even when
    there is no Internet connectivity. This could also potentially store a
    uniform resorce locator (URL) that leads to a webpage that has all the
    details about that element. This will enable learners with smartphones that
    are not powerful enough to run the Quantarks app to view the content on the
    web instead. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, we didn't have the
    opportunity to embed the information or the URL in the QR codes, so we
    settled on using the element's names instead.

  <li>
    <b>It should be cost-effective, and as cheap to produce as possible.</b> The
    marker cards and the periodic table are made of sintra board. All of these
    costed us â‚±2,160.00 at that time. If these are to be mass produced, the cost
    could go lower. If this project was also to be funded by the institution
    that will use it, the cost could be much cheaper for the teacher and the
    learners that would avail of it. This price could go even lower, as the
    markers could be printed on paper in grayscale. Since the QR code's pattern
    is not dependent on color, the markers could be printed on bond paper and
    reproduced using photocopiers.
  </li>
  

</ul>



<h4>Results</h4>


<p>
  We were not able to test this application in a real world setting. However,
  our team participated in the school's thesis exhibit where students and
  visitors got their hands on our app. The reviews were generally good, with a
  few of them noticing the flaws of the application. Our project was also among
  the ten best thesis projects of that year in our university.
